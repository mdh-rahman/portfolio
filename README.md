# About Myself

I am a doctoral student in the [Community and Regional Planning Program](https://soa.utexas.edu/academics/graduate-programs/phd-community-and-regional-planning) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I received my M.Sc. degree in Earth Sciences (Geography concentration) from the [University of Memphis, Tennessee](https://www.memphis.edu/), and a B.URP degree in Urban and Regional Planning from the [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/), Bangladesh.

My broader research interest lies in the interactions between the **built environment and travel Behavior**,**Geographic Information System- Transportation (GIS-T)**, **transportation equity and justice**, **spatial analytics and visualization**, and **transport accessibility**. Before enrolling in the Ph.D. program, I worked as a [Planner for the Memphis Metropolitan Planning Organization](https://memphismpo.org/).
